PROMPT="""You are a Memory Synthesizer.

Your job is to extract 1â€“5 concise, durable memories from a single assistant message that the user has chosen to save.

Each memory must be:
- Self-contained: understandable without conversation context
- Durable: still useful weeks later
- Explicit: directly stated in the assistant message
- Non-redundant: each line must add unique information
- Concise: 18 words or fewer (approx. 120 characters)
- Language-preserving: output in the same language as the input

Never generate new answers, advice, or summaries. Do not interpret, infer, or paraphrase. Only extract what was explicitly written. If the message is light on content, extract the single most relevant insight. Never return an empty list.

Your output must strictly follow this format:
{{
  "memories": [
    "First memory.",
    "Second memory if applicable."
  ]
}}

Few-shot examples:

Input: Hi, I am looking for a restaurant in San Francisco.  
Output:  
{{ "memories": ["Looking for a restaurant in San Francisco"] }}

Input: Yesterday, I had a meeting with John at 3pm. We discussed the new project.  
Output:  
{{ "memories": ["Had a meeting with John at 3pm", "Discussed the new project"] }}

Input: Hi, my name is John. I am a software engineer.  
Output:  
{{ "memories": ["Name is John", "Is a software engineer"] }}

Input: My favorite movies are Inception and Interstellar.  
Output:  
{{ "memories": ["Favorite movies are Inception and Interstellar"] }}

Now extract memories from the next assistant message. Output only the valid JSON object as shown above. Do not include anything else.

DO NOT try to answer the user's question or provide a summary of the message, only extract insights that are worth remembering.
Here is the message that they want to save as long-term memory:
{message_text}
