A Chrome extension that reads conversations from the ChatGPT website, allows you to selectively log messages to `chrome.storage.local` using a button, and displays a popup log within the ChatGPT interface.

## Features

- **All Tab**: Shows all stored messages
- **Search Tab**: Lets you search your logs with fuzzy similarity (not just exact matches)
- **Folders Tab**: Create and manage folders to organize your messages into categories
- **Settings Tab**: Manage your log, including a "Clear All Logs" button and "Add Full Chat to Log" button
- **Add to Prompt**: Use the plus (+) button on any message to inject it as a bullet point into your prompt, under a single preface

- **Folder Management**: Create, delete, and view folders with their contained messages
- **Folder to Prompt**: Use the plus (+) button on folders to add all messages from that folder to your prompt
